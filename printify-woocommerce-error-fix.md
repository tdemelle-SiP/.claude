# Fix for Printify Upload Error

## Issue
When uploading a product to Printify, the following error occurs:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'formatEventType')
    at updateLastEvent (popup-window.js?ver=1746805832:364:51)
    at Object.updateEventsList (popup-window.js?ver=1746805832:331:17)
    at Object.sip-woocommerce-monitor:popup_action (popup-window.js?ver=1746805832:391:48)
    at handleSuccessResponse (ajax.js?ver=1746819930:124:49)
    at Object.success (ajax.js?ver=1746819930:62:21)
```

## Analysis
The error occurs in the `sip-woocommerce-monitor` plugin's `popup-window.js` file, specifically in the `updateLastEvent` function. This function is trying to access a `formatEventType` property on an undefined value.

The error happens during an AJAX response from the `sip-printify-manager` plugin, which is triggering code in the WooCommerce monitor's popup window.

## Recommended Fix

### 1. In `popup-window.js` of the `sip-woocommerce-monitor` plugin

Add a null check before accessing `formatEventType` around line 364:

```javascript
function updateLastEvent(event) {
    // Ensure event exists before trying to access properties
    if (!event) {
        console.warn('Attempted to update with undefined event');
        return;
    }
    
    // Then proceed with the existing code
    // Example (based on error):
    const formattedType = event.formatEventType ? event.formatEventType() : 'Unknown';
    // Rest of the function...
}
```

### 2. Alternatively, if the response from `sip-printify-manager` is expected to include event data

Fix the AJAX response in the `sip-printify-manager` plugin to ensure it includes all expected event data:

```php
// In sip-printify-manager's AJAX handler for upload product
SiP_AJAX_Response::success(
    'sip-printify-manager',
    'popup_action',
    'upload_product',
    [
        'event' => [
            'type' => 'upload',
            'status' => 'success',
            'formatEventType' => 'upload', // Ensure this value is included if needed
            // Other event data...
        ]
    ],
    'Product uploaded successfully'
);
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The issue appears to be an interaction between the `sip-printify-manager` and `sip-woocommerce-monitor` plugins.

2. The printify plugin is likely using the woocommerce monitor's popup functionality but not providing the complete data structure expected by the popup window.

3. The best fix is to implement the null check in the `updateLastEvent` function to make it more robust against missing data.

4. If both plugins have access to the shared popup window code, consider standardizing the event data format in the `.claude/documentation.md` file to prevent similar issues in the future.
