# Load Into Creation Table - Improvement Summary

## Overview
Based on the execution audit, here are the recommended improvements to bring the "Load Into Creation Table" feature into compliance with SiP plugin standards.

## Issues Identified

1. **Cross-Table AJAX Routing** - Working as designed (no change needed)
2. **Template Name Processing** - Redundant string manipulation
3. **Multiple WIP File Checks** - Inefficient file system access
4. **Data Storage Redundancy** - To be addressed separately
5. **Function Existence Checks** - Indicates poor module dependency management
6. **Debug Logging** - Using error_log() instead of controlled debug
7. **Single WIP File** - Working as designed (no change needed)

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Template Name Processing
- Add `basename` field to template data structure
- Process filename once in `sip_load_templates_for_table()`
- Pass basename throughout without further manipulation
- See: `/recommendations/template-name-processing.md`

### 2. WIP File Lifecycle
- Consolidate WIP operations into single entry point
- Check, create, and load in one operation
- Pass data instead of re-reading files
- See: `/recommendations/wip-file-lifecycle.md`

### 3. Module Dependencies
- Implement module registry pattern
- Ensure initialization order
- Remove defensive function checks
- See: `/recommendations/module-dependencies.md`

### 4. Debug Logging
- Create PHP debug utility matching JS pattern
- Replace error_log() with sip_debug()
- Respect debug enabled setting
- See: `/recommendations/debug-logging-standards.md`

## Implementation Priority

1. **Debug Logging** (Easy, high impact)
   - Create utility class
   - Replace error_log calls
   - Test debug on/off

2. **Template Name Processing** (Medium complexity)
   - Update data structure
   - Modify JS and PHP handling
   - Test template operations

3. **WIP File Lifecycle** (Medium complexity)
   - Refactor file operations
   - Update calling code
   - Test creation flow

4. **Module Dependencies** (Higher complexity)
   - Design registry system
   - Update all modules
   - Test initialization

## Testing Checklist

After each improvement:
- [ ] Load template into creation table works
- [ ] Correct template is highlighted
- [ ] WIP file is created properly
- [ ] Image/product tables update
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Debug logs only when enabled

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. Update coding standards to include:
   - Template name handling pattern
   - WIP file operation standards
   - Module initialization requirements
   - Debug logging requirements

2. Add to architecture documentation:
   - Cross-table AJAX routing explanation
   - WIP file lifecycle diagram
   - Module dependency graph
