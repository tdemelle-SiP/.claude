Tasks will follow a plan->work->review procedural framework.

## PLAN STAGE MESSAGE

Here is the message I will send at the beginning of a task after explaining the goals of the task and other relevant details.

----

Before you begin, 
It is absolutely critical that you read the guidelines at /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/.claude/Coding_Guidelines_Snapshot.txt. it contains a process overview and behavioral requirements for the three stages that all tasks will follow: the Plan Stage, the Work Stage and the Review Stage.  Again, these are behavioral requirements; this is not reference material.   All resources that you apply to this task must adhere to these behavioral requirements.  Read the entire document and carefully follow all steps.

Begin by carefully reviewing the details of the task that the user is asking for your help with.   Images shared by the user will be uploaded here: /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Documents/VSCode_Images_Repo/. If the user uploads an image, look for the most recent image in this directory.

When you have reviewed the task details, create a task document in /work/ using the working-task-template found here:

/mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/.claude/working-task-template.md.

Proceed to work through the steps outlined in the Coding Guidelines Snapshot document. As you work through the steps you will fill the template out so that when you have finished the planning steps, your context will consist of an informed understanding and plan for accomplishing the specified task.

----

This commences the work stage. When you have implemented the solution in the code, you should announce your completion in the chat and walk through your review of the implemented code holding it to the coding standards.

---
Please review all the code implemented in the course of your working task against the SiP Code Standards

## CODE QUALITY PRINCIPLES

Keep code simple, clean and straightforward. Do not over-complicate, over-engineer or write overly abstract or overly defensive code.

Do not take shortcuts to prioritize speed. Always prioritize being thorough, careful, doing the job right and working from definitive understanding instead of speculation.
 
When you are addressing code issues, always be aware when you may be reactively treating symptoms instead of understanding the larger code context at the root of the problem. Stop doing the former, which will invariably lead to unnecessary complexity and technical debt, and instead focus on the latter which will result in clean elegant code that embodies robust and sustainable patterns and standards that are scalable across the plugin suite.

When coding, stay focused on WHY the problem exists and solving THAT problem. Code from first principles, not from pattern matched hacks.

### CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST

Review your code against this checklist. If your solution involves ANY of these patterns, STOP and reconsider:

**‚ùå Timing & Defensive Patterns**
‚ñ° setTimeout/setInterval for waiting (vs. intentional delays)
‚ñ° try-catch blocks for errors that shouldn't exist
‚ñ° Defensive checks (function_exists, class_exists, isset, hasOwnProperty)
‚ñ° Event handler workarounds
‚ñ° State management to track framework behavior

**‚ùå UI & Storage Patterns**
‚ñ° Inline CSS styles (when not for dynamic values)
‚ñ° Multiple redundant storage/recovery mechanisms
‚ñ° Multiple truth sources for same data

**‚ùå Implementation Standards**
‚ñ° Parameter naming variations (e.g., action_name vs action_type)
‚ñ° Hook timing differences from documented patterns
‚ñ° Response format deviations from standard structures
‚ñ° JavaScript utility usage that bypasses documented methods

**üìã Pattern-Specific Checkpoints**
‚ñ° AJAX: Parameter naming matches between PHP/JS
‚ñ° DataTables: Proper cleanup before destroy()
‚ñ° UI Components: Using SiP.Core utilities

---

The completion of the work stage leads to the review stage.

## REVIEW STAGE MESSAGE

Here is the message I will send after reviewing the completed task.

----

 Please look over the documentation files to make sure that they are accurate and reflect the current functioning of the code.   
 
 Start by reviewing /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/.claude/index.md to refresh yourself with the overall structure and the principles behind it.  
 
 Then Please make sure to check on all related documentation in the /guidelines/ directory to ensure that relevant files reflect updated standards correctly where appropriate and don't retain any deprecated references.

 If you are adding or supplementing documentation, please make sure that you are adding it correctly according to the pattern used to document other sip plugins, core features or development tools and methods and that it is correctly referenced and linked in all expected and useful contexts.
 
 If there were aspects of the code that were unclear to you as you worked, carefully adhering to the documentation guidelines, please update the documentation to reflect the patterns, principles and structures that were needed to correctly implement your solution.
 
 Please review the documentation from the perspective of a developer and ensure that if faced with understanding and working with the established standards, you could confidently refer to the documentation and come away with a complete clear understanding of how to work with the principles and patterns of the codebase.  Don't forget the rules...

<!-- DOCUMENTATION RULES:
1. ARCHITECTURAL WHY - Document WHY each component exists (constraints/requirements that necessitate it)
2. NO HISTORY - Current state only, not how we got here  
3. NO DUPLICATION - Each fact appears exactly once
4. EXAMPLES OVER EXPLANATIONS - Explain briefly , but emphasize showing over telling
5. UPDATE THE RIGHT SECTION - Check if info already exists before adding
   
When you're done, please provide a commit message to include when I submit the changes in source control.

                          SIP PLUGIN SUITE CODING GUIDELINES
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

Begin by reading this document in its entirety.

When you are done reading this document, read the main file of the documentation that describes what all the more detailed guidelines contain so that you can assess which are relevant to the current task and include that information in your working-task document.

/mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local
  Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/.claude/index.md
  
When you have finished reviewing the index.md and the relevant guidelines, (**Read ALL identified relevant documentation completely** - do not skim or read only first sections) look over the relevant code files. Identify the patterns that they follow and how they relate to the documentation you've read.  If there are patterns present that you haven't encountered in the documentation you've reviewed, return to the documentation to familiarize yourself with those patterns.  If there are patterns that are not documented, mention them in the questions section of your working-task document.  If documentation is unclear or incomplete, request clarification rather than making assumptions about correct implementation.

## CODE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

When you are analyzing code in order to understand how it functions or to understand why a bug is occurring, please don't be satisfied basing your analysis and recommendation on what a superficial read of the immediate code suggests, what it seems like or what it "might" be; look at the actual code context when you have a theory and replace your speculation with a definitive understanding of the actual situation.  
 
Systematically follow through the whole code sequence in question from beginning to end without making any leaps in logic based on assumptions so that you understand the structure of the entire contextual framework before drilling into details speculatively.

BEFORE drawing conclusions from or modifying code:
REQUIRE verification = {
    data_structure: INSPECT actual runtime data,        
    css_classes: INSPECT actual DOM elements,
    field_names: MATCH exact property names,
    assumptions: COUNT must equal 0
}

IF assumption_needed THEN {
    STOP;
    ASK user for verification;
    WAIT for response;
}

When you have finished the document and code review steps and completed the working-task file, post its contents in the chat and we will discuss your proposed approach. When we've agreed on a final approach, I will explicitly intruct you to begin coding.

## WORK STAGE

Execute the task following your plan and adhering to the Coding Guidelines outlined below.

When you've finished the work, please confirm that you're work is done in the chat and conduct a methodical assessement of the completed work against the coding guidelines outlined below.  Conclude by assessing how well your work adhered to the coding guidelines. Would a seasoned senior enterprise developer approve of this clean, simple solution that makes the right thing automatic and the wrong thing difficult if not impossible?

## REVIEW STAGE

At this point I will review the output of the work stage as described above in the post work message. 

That will lead to potential revision, documentation updates and commit message creation.

If the commit checks out, I will let you know that the task is complete at which timeoutId
**Move the working file** to `/work/archived_tasks/` folder
   - Keep the same filename for reference
   - This preserves task history and decisions made

 Do not code without explicit direction to do so.  Do not make changes beyond those clearly stated in the working task file.

  Update the working-task-template throughout the task to track progress - This file serves as your external memory for the task

If there is cause to code using methods or standards that are not detailed in the documentation or in the task goals themselves, stop what you are doing and explain the situation in chat so that the new approach can be discussed and validated before you implement it with explicit direction to do so.

If in the course of review or implementation you have ideas for additions or alternate approaches, stop what you're doing and mention them in a chat message so that we can discuss them, decide upon the best path forward and you can proceed with coding with explicit direction.

## CRITICAL DIRECTIVES

Critical non-negotiable directive: No Task Agent Delegation

  When working with AI assistants on this codebase, the AI must handle all coding tasks directly without delegating to secondary agents or tools. This ensures:

  - Full conversation context is preserved
  - Project-specific requirements and nuances are maintained
  - Coding style and guidelines are consistently applied
  - Direct accountability for all code changes       

  Use file reading, editing, and searching tools directly rather than invoking any "Task" agents or similar delegation mechanisms.

### DETAILED ANTI-PATTERN GUIDANCE

## SYMPTOM VS ROOT CAUSE DISTINCTION

Symptom vs. Root Cause: A Critical Distinction

  The Problem Pattern:
  When encountering an error, there are two paths:
  1. Symptom Treatment: Adding defensive code around the error point
  2. Root Cause Resolution: Understanding WHY the error occurs and fixing the underlying issue      

  Example of Symptom Treatment (WRONG):
  // Error: Call to undefined function sip_plugin_storage()
  // Symptom treatment: Add defensive check
  if (function_exists('sip_plugin_storage')) {
      sip_plugin_storage()->register_plugin(...);
  }
  This "fixes" the error but creates technical debt:
  - The defensive check will exist forever
  - Every usage requires this check
  - The real problem remains hidden
  - Code becomes cluttered with defensive patterns

  Example of Root Cause Resolution (CORRECT):
  // Error: Call to undefined function sip_plugin_storage()
  // Investigation: When is this code running vs. when is the function available?
  // Discovery: Running at plugin load, but function available at 'init'
  // Root cause fix: Align timing
  add_action('init', function() {
      sip_plugin_storage()->register_plugin(...);
  }, 5);
  This fixes the actual problem:
  - No defensive code needed
  - Clean, simple implementation
  - Problem solved permanently
  - Code expresses proper dependencies

  How to Identify You're Treating Symptoms

  Warning Signs:
  - Adding if (function_exists()), if (class_exists()), try/catch blocks reactively
  - Adding isset() checks for variables that "should" exist
  - Creating workarounds for "edge cases" that keep appearing
  - Defensive coding that protects against "what if" scenarios
  - Multiple layers of error handling for the same issue

  The Correct Approach:
  1. Ask "Why?" - Why is this function undefined? Why is this variable missing?
  2. Trace the Execution - When does my code run? When is the dependency available?
  3. Find the Mismatch - There's always a logical reason for the error
  4. Fix the Root Cause - Align timing, fix initialization order, correct dependencies

  Key Principle

  If you're adding defensive code to prevent an error, STOP.
  You're treating a symptom. Instead:
  - Understand the execution flow
  - Identify the timing/dependency mismatch
  - Fix the structural problem
  - The error should become impossible, not defended against

  Real-World Application

  In the WordPress plugin context:
  - Symptom: Function undefined errors ‚Üí Adding function_exists() checks
  - Root Cause: Wrong hook timing ‚Üí Move code to appropriate hook
  - Symptom: Missing array keys ‚Üí Adding isset() checks everywhere
  - Root Cause: Incomplete initialization ‚Üí Fix initialization logic
  - Symptom: Null object errors ‚Üí Adding null checks before every usage
  - Root Cause: Object not created when expected ‚Üí Fix creation timing

  The goal is code that CAN'T fail because it's structurally correct, not code that's defended against failure.

## LEGITIMATE setTimeout USAGE

When setTimeout IS Appropriate (Industry Standard Patterns)

  setTimeout is NOT always a symptom. There are legitimate, industry-standard uses where it's the correct solution:

  1. Browser Extension Content Script Announcement
  CORRECT USE:
  // Content scripts announcing to host page
  setTimeout(() => {
      window.postMessage({ type: 'EXTENSION_READY' }, '*');
  }, 100);
  
  WHY IT'S CORRECT:
  - Known browser behavior: content scripts inject asynchronously
  - Industry standard: Used by major extensions (Grammarly, 1Password, AdBlock)
  - Not masking an error: The timing variance is inherent to the platform
  - Simple and reliable: More complex solutions add unnecessary state management

  2. Yielding to Browser Event Loop
  CORRECT USE:
  // After DOM manipulation, let browser recalculate
  element.style.display = 'block';
  setTimeout(() => {
      element.classList.add('animate-in');
  }, 0);
  
  WHY IT'S CORRECT:
  - Forces style recalculation between property changes
  - Allows browser to process pending UI updates
  - Standard pattern for CSS transitions/animations

  3. Debouncing User Input
  CORRECT USE:
  let timeoutId;
  searchInput.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
          performSearch(e.target.value);
      }, 300);
  });
  
  WHY IT'S CORRECT:
  - Intentional delay to improve performance
  - Prevents excessive API calls
  - Standard UX pattern

  INCORRECT setTimeout Usage (Symptom Treatment)

  1. Waiting for Elements to Exist
  WRONG:
  setTimeout(() => {
      const button = document.getElementById('submit-button');
      button.addEventListener('click', handler);
  }, 1000);
  
  CORRECT:
  // Use proper lifecycle hooks or MutationObserver
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const button = document.getElementById('submit-button');
      button.addEventListener('click', handler);
  });

  2. Waiting for Variables to Initialize
  WRONG:
  setTimeout(() => {
      if (window.myApp) {
          window.myApp.init();
      }
  }, 500);
  
  CORRECT:
  // Fix initialization order or use proper events
  window.addEventListener('myAppReady', () => {
      window.myApp.init();
  });

  3. Fixing Race Conditions
  WRONG:
  saveData();
  setTimeout(() => {
      loadData(); // Hope save is done...
  }, 200);
  
  CORRECT:
  // Use promises or callbacks
  saveData().then(() => {
      loadData();
  });

  Key Distinction:
  - LEGITIMATE: When delay is intentional for platform/UX reasons
  - SYMPTOM: When delay is hoping something else happens first

  Ask yourself: "Am I using setTimeout because I WANT a delay, or because I'm HOPING something 
  will be ready?" If it's hope, fix the root cause.

## MULTIPLE REDUNDANT STORAGE ("Belt and Suspenders")
  
The Problem Pattern:
Creating multiple ways to store/recover the same data "just in case" something fails.
  
  Example of Multiple Redundant Storage (WRONG):
  // Shop authorization - creating multiple recovery paths
  // PHP: Store in database
  update_option('shop_name', $shop_name);
  
  // JavaScript: Also store in localStorage "just in case"
  localStorage.setItem('shop_name', shopName);
  
  // PHP: Add fallback to re-fetch if missing
  if (empty($shop_name)) {
      $shop_name = fetch_shop_details($token)['shop_name'];
  }
  
  This creates technical debt:
  - Confusion about which source is authoritative
  - Sync issues between storage locations  
  - False sense of robustness
  - Hides the real bug (why is shop_name empty?)
  
  Example of Single Source of Truth (CORRECT):
  // PHP: Store once in the authoritative location
  update_option('shop_name', $shop_name);
  
  // JavaScript: Display what server returns
  if (response.data.shop_name) {
      $('.shop-name').text(response.data.shop_name);
  }
  
  // Trust that WordPress options work correctly
  // Fix any bugs at the source, not with recovery layers
  
  Key Principle:
  If you're creating multiple ways to recover the same data, STOP.
  You're treating a symptom. Instead:
  - Find out why the primary storage isn't working
  - Fix that root cause
  - Trust your data flow

## SPECIFIC PATTERN COMPLIANCE

**AJAX IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Read sip-plugin-ajax.md completely before any AJAX work
- Verify parameter naming: $_POST[$action_type] matches JavaScript createFormData() second parameter
- Test AJAX call with browser dev tools before considering complete
- Check that response routing follows documented three-level structure

**DATATABLES IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Read sip-feature-datatables.md for table patterns
- Follow client-side processing standards
- Implement proper cleanup before destroy()

**UI COMPONENTS:**
- Read sip-feature-ui-components.md for UI patterns
- Use SiP.Core utilities for all UI operations
- Follow the three-layer visibility structure for tables

## CODE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

When searching and replacing to update code, do not rely on your saved context for your search string; check the actual code to ensure your search string is accurate.

Never use write to file to make code updates.

BEFORE drawing conclusions from or modifying code:
REQUIRE verification = {
    data_structure: INSPECT actual runtime data,        
    css_classes: INSPECT actual DOM elements,
    field_names: MATCH exact property names,
    assumptions: COUNT must equal 0
}

IF assumption_needed THEN {
    STOP;
    ASK user for verification;
    WAIT for response;
}

## No Legacy Code
 
Do not preserve legacy code.  Clean up all remnants of unused or deprecated code thoroughly.  Do not implement backward compatibility code. Backward combatibility is unnecessary complexity that creates confusion and masks errors that should be fixed.  If we're in transition, we don't handle that with backward compatibility code. We handle that by letting the code throw errors and using those errors as cues to get all the code up to the correct standard.

Do not create custom test tools or instructions unless explicitly asked to do so.  Testing will take place in the actual code.

## WORK COMPLETION REQUIREMENT

Before reporting that implementation is complete:
1. **Update the Task Working File** - Mark all completed items in the Work Checkpoint section
2. **Verify all planned tasks are complete** - Check that nothing was missed
3. **Run through the Standards Compliance Verification** checklist
4. **Report completion status** referencing the working file

## CODE TRACING METHODOLOGY

 Please trace the logical sequence of events that the code follows incremental step by incremental logical step through all paths that extend from the user executing the Load Into Creation Table action in the template table in /plugins/sip-printify-manager/. Follow the logic making no leaps other than those explicitly described in the actual code all the way through to their conclusion when the events following the Load Into Creation Table action conclude. This is a complex multi-step process that spans nearly all the sip printify manager plugin files and all elements of the dashboard. The files that you must refer to will be in the /plugins/sip-printify-manager/ directory and may also be in the plugins/sip-plugins-core/ directory. I am asking you to follow the logic of the code uncompromisingly taking no leap that is not explicit in the actual code.

For each step in the process please add a single concise line to the audit file located at /plugins/.claude/audits/creation-table-load-execution-audit.md citing the step taken, the file and line number.

The purpose of this exercise is to have a complete and accurate accounting of the entire Load into Creation Table code sequence with NO assumptions so that we can assess it for whether it adheres to all platform standards, identify elements of the code that are not in use or not compliant with standards and remove them and update the documentation so that it clearly and completely documents all standards and patterns in a well-structured, accessible and intuitive manner according to the principles and documentation framework outlined in the /plugins/.claude/index.md file
