# SiP Plugin Suite Documentation Audit & Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document contains the results of a comprehensive audit of all 19 documentation files in the `.claude/guidelines/` directory, assessed against the 10 documentation rules established for the SiP Plugin Suite. The audit identified key violations and provides a prioritized implementation plan to bring all documentation into compliance.

## Documentation Rules (Reference)

1. **NO FUTURE OR HISTORY** - No predictions, roadmaps, or changelogs
2. **ARCHITECTURAL WHY** - Explain design decisions, not just implementation
3. **EXAMPLES OVER EXPLANATIONS** - Show working code examples
4. **DIAGRAM BEFORE PROSE** - Visual representations first
5. **CODE LIMITS** - <50 lines per example, with clear focus
6. **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - No duplicate information
7. **STRUCTURED HIERARCHY** - Clear section organization
8. **CONCISE HEADERS** - Brief, descriptive section titles
9. **ACTIVE VOICE** - Direct, clear language
10. **CONSISTENT TERMINOLOGY** - Unified vocabulary across docs

## Audit Results by Priority

#### 6. sip-plugin-data-storage.md
**Severity**: Medium - Critical concept but well documented
**Major Violations**:
- ❌ Rule 4: Storage hierarchy diagram in middle of document
- ❌ Rule 3: Some storage types lack practical examples
**Required Actions**:
- Move ASCII storage hierarchy to top

- Break up large code blocks
- Add quick reference card

### 🟢 Low Priority - Standards & Guidelines

These documents are important for consistency but have less immediate impact.

#### 9. sip-development-documentation.md
**Severity**: Low - Meta-documentation
**Minor Violations**:
- Could use more bad/good example pairs
- Some sections are prescriptive without examples
**Suggested Improvements**:
- Add more concrete before/after examples
- Include templates for common patterns
- Show real violations from codebase

#### 10. sip-development-css.md
**Severity**: Low - Important but stable
**Minor Violations**:
- Lacks visual examples of naming patterns
- Rule-heavy without practical application
**Suggested Improvements**:
- Add visual examples of BEM naming
- Include refactoring case studies
- Show responsive design patterns visually

#### 11. sip-feature-progress-dialog.md
**Severity**: Low - Specialized feature
**Minor Violations**:
- Minimal architectural explanation
- Could benefit from sequence diagram
**Suggested Improvements**:
- Add sequence diagram for batch operations
- Explain architectural decisions
- Show integration with different operation types

#### 12-19. Other Plugin-Specific Documentation
**General Patterns**:
- Most follow structure well
- Could benefit from more diagrams
- Examples sometimes too long
- "Why" explanations often missing

### 🔧 Special Cases

#### mockup-map-analysis.md
- **Type**: Research/analysis document
- **Issue**: Not standard documentation
- **Action**: Move to `.claude/work/` or clearly mark as analysis

#### sip-development-release-mgmt.md
- **Issue**: Contains both ASCII and Mermaid diagrams (duplication)
- **Issue**: Mermaid diagram incomplete (cuts off)
- **Action**: Complete Mermaid diagram, remove ASCII version

## Resource Requirements

- **Time**: 4 weeks for full implementation
- **Tools**: Mermaid diagram editor, code formatter
- **Review**: Architecture team input on "why" sections
- **Testing**: Validate all code examples work

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking existing references
  - **Mitigation**: Update incrementally, maintain redirects
  
- **Risk**: Over-correction making docs too terse
  - **Mitigation**: Balance examples with necessary context
  
- **Risk**: Diagram maintenance burden
  - **Mitigation**: Use text-based Mermaid for version control
