## Task: Fix Debug State Persistence and Console Output for SIP Printify Manager Extension
**Date Started:** 2025-07-03 10:52

### Task Understanding
**What:** Fix the debug system to stop repeatedly announcing debug level and ensure NORMAL mode only shows important operations, not verbose initialization logs
**Why:** The console is cluttered with 39+ repeated debug level announcements and verbose logs that should only appear in VERBOSE mode, making it difficult to see important information
**Success Criteria:** 
- Debug level announced only once on page load
- Level changes announced only when actually changing
- NORMAL mode shows only important operations
- No explanations about what debug modes do

### Documentation Review
- [x] sip-development-testing-debug.md - Defines three-level debug system and proper usage
- [x] sip-printify-manager-extension-widget.md - Documents extension debug synchronization

### Files to Modify
- /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/sip-plugins-core/assets/js/core/debug.js
- /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Repositories/sip-printify-manager-extension/core-scripts/widget-debug.js
- /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Repositories/sip-printify-manager-extension/action-scripts/widget-tabs-actions.js

### Implementation Plan
1. Add change detection to WordPress debug.js to only announce real level changes
2. Add change detection to extension widget-debug.js to prevent duplicate announcements
3. Simplify debug announcements - just show level, no explanations
4. Update widget-tabs-actions.js initialization logs from normal() to verbose()
5. Test all three debug levels to ensure proper behavior

### Questions/Blockers
None - the issue is clear and the solution is straightforward
