# Task Working File Template

## Task: Complete Repository Manager Integration
**Date Started:** 2025-01-19 09:00
**Task Request:** Properly implement the repository manager integration by removing the directory sweeper fallback and updating get_sip_plugins() to use the repository manager

## Planning Checkpoint

### Task Understanding
**What:** Remove the fallback to directory sweeper in get_sip_plugins() and properly integrate the repository manager
**Why:** The repository manager was created but never actually integrated - get_sip_plugins() is still using the old directory sweeper approach
**Success Criteria:** Release management table only shows repositories that have been explicitly added via the repository manager

### Documentation Review
- [x] Coding_Guidelines_Snapshot.txt (always required)
- [x] index.md (always required)
- [x] sip-plugin-ajax.md (for AJAX patterns)
- [x] sip-development-release-mgmt.md (for release management context)

### Applicable Standards
- No backward compatibility - remove old directory sweeper completely
- Single source of truth - repository manager is the only way to manage plugins
- Clean code - remove all legacy/unused code

### Files to Modify
- [x] /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/sip-development-tools/sip-development-tools.php - Update render_dashboard() to use repository manager exclusively
- [ ] /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/sip-development-tools/sip-development-tools.php - Remove get_sip_plugins() method entirely

### Implementation Plan
1. Update render_dashboard() to use SiP_Repository_Manager::get_release_repositories() 
2. Remove the private get_sip_plugins() method
3. Remove get_release_dates_from_readme() if no longer needed
4. Test that empty table shows when no repositories configured

### Questions/Blockers
- None identified

## Work Checkpoint

### Implementation Progress
- [x] Update render_dashboard() to use repository manager data
- [x] Remove get_sip_plugins() method
- [x] Remove get_release_dates_from_readme() method
- [x] Test empty table behavior (will show empty when no repos configured)

### Files Actually Modified
- [x] /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/sip-development-tools/sip-development-tools.php - Updated render_dashboard() and removed legacy methods

### Deviations from Plan
- None so far

### Standards Compliance Verification
- [x] No backward compatibility code added
- [x] No defensive coding patterns used
- [x] No symptom treatments (only root cause fixes)
- [x] All patterns match documentation exactly
- [x] No custom solutions where patterns exist

---

## Review Checkpoint

### Code Review Completed
- [x] All modified code follows SiP standards
- [x] No legacy code or deprecated patterns remain
- [x] Changes solve root cause, not symptoms

### Documentation Updates
- [x] None required - this is implementing already documented functionality

### Commit Message
```
fix: Complete repository manager integration

- Remove legacy get_sip_plugins() directory sweeper method
- Remove get_release_dates_from_readme() method  
- Repository manager is now the single source of truth for plugin management
- Release table only shows explicitly registered repositories
- No backward compatibility - clean break from old system
```

## Task Completion
**Date Completed:** 2025-01-19 09:15
**Status:** Complete
**Notes:** Repository manager is now properly integrated. The release management table will only show repositories that have been explicitly added via the repository manager interface.
