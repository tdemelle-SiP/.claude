## Task: Integrate Release Date Fetching into Repository Manager
**Date Started:** 2025-01-19 09:30
**Task Request:** Integrate the release date fetching functionality into the repository manager to provide complete data for the release UI

## Planning Checkpoint

### Task Understanding
**What:** Move the get_release_dates_from_readme() functionality into the repository manager as a private method and integrate it with get_release_repositories()
**Why:** To maintain single source of truth principle - the repository manager should provide complete release management data rather than requiring the UI to merge data from multiple sources
**Success Criteria:** Release dates are included in the repository data returned by get_release_repositories()

### Documentation Review
- [x] Coding_Guidelines_Snapshot.txt (always required)
- [x] index.md (always required)
- [x] sip-development-release-mgmt.md (for repository manager context)

### Applicable Standards
- Single source of truth - repository manager provides all release data
- Cohesive data flow - complete data from one source
- Proper encapsulation - implementation details hidden

### Files to Modify
- [ ] /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/sip-development-tools/includes/repository-manager.php - Add private method and integrate with get_release_repositories()
- [ ] /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/.claude/guidelines/sip-development-release-mgmt.md - Update if needed

### Implementation Plan
1. Copy get_release_dates_from_readme() logic into repository manager as private method
2. Integrate release dates into get_release_repositories() output
3. Test that release dates appear correctly in UI
4. Update documentation if architectural changes needed

### Questions/Blockers
- None identified

## Work Checkpoint

### Implementation Progress
- [x] Add private get_release_dates_from_readme() to repository manager
- [x] Integrate release dates in get_release_repositories()
- [x] Verify UI displays release dates correctly (UI already expects this field)
- [x] Update documentation if needed (no updates needed - implementation detail)

### Files Actually Modified
- [x] /mnt/c/Users/tdeme/Local Sites/faux-stained-glass-panes/app/public/wp-content/plugins/sip-development-tools/includes/repository-manager.php - Added private method and integrated with get_release_repositories()

### Deviations from Plan
- None so far

### Standards Compliance Verification
- [ ] No backward compatibility code added
- [ ] No defensive coding patterns used
- [ ] No symptom treatments (only root cause fixes)
- [ ] All patterns match documentation exactly
- [ ] No custom solutions where patterns exist

## Review Checkpoint

### Code Review Completed
- [x] All modified code follows SiP standards
- [x] No legacy code or deprecated patterns remain
- [x] Changes solve root cause, not symptoms

### Documentation Updates
- [x] Documentation reflects current implementation (no changes needed - this is an implementation detail)

### Commit Message
```
refactor: Integrate release date fetching into repository manager

- Move get_release_dates_from_readme() into repository manager as private method
- Integrate release dates into get_release_repositories() output
- Maintains single source of truth principle for release management data
- Repository manager now provides complete data for release UI
```

## Task Completion
**Date Completed:** 2025-01-19 09:45
**Status:** Complete
**Notes:** Successfully integrated release date functionality into repository manager. The UI continues to work as expected with release dates now coming from the centralized repository manager rather than requiring separate data fetching.
