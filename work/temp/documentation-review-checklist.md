# Documentation Review Checklist for Extension Installer Centralization

## Documentation Compliance Checklist

### Completed Tasks:

☑ **Re-read index.md** to understand documentation structure
- Added reference to Extension Installer in Core Components section
- Added Extension Architecture Vision section with link to vision document
- Added note that master extension is future vision, current state uses individual extensions

☑ **Reviewed all documentation files affected by changes**
- Updated sip-printify-manager-extension-widget.md (already up to date)
- Updated sip-master-extension-architecture.md vision document
- Updated sip-feature-ui-components.md with Extension Installer section

☑ **Updated documentation reflects current code functionality**
- Extension installer is now in SiP Plugins Core
- Manual install button uses core installer with fallback
- Installation wizard available without Printify Manager active

☑ **No deprecated references remain in documentation**
- Checked for old references to embedded extension
- Vision document clearly marked as future vision
- Current implementation documented accurately

☑ **New patterns/principles properly documented**
- Extension Installer added to UI Components guide
- Integration pattern documented with fallback approach
- Centralized management principle established

☑ **Documentation follows established patterns**
- Extension Installer follows same documentation pattern as other UI components
- Code examples provided
- Usage and features clearly explained

☑ **All cross-references and links are correct**
- Added links between index.md and vision document
- Extension documentation properly linked in index

☑ **Documentation provides complete understanding**
- Clear explanation of current vs future architecture
- Pragmatic approach documented
- Migration path preserved for future

☑ **Architectural WHY is documented**
- Vision document explains why incremental approach taken
- Current state section explains problems solved
- Future considerations clearly outlined

☑ **No duplication - each fact appears exactly once**
- Extension installer documented in UI Components
- Vision separate from current implementation
- No redundant information

☑ **Examples provided where appropriate**
- Code examples for using extension installer
- Integration pattern with fallback
- Clear usage examples

## Summary of Changes:

1. **index.md**: Added Extension Installer to Core Components, added Extension Architecture Vision section
2. **sip-master-extension-architecture.md**: Updated to clarify it's a future vision, added current state section
3. **sip-feature-ui-components.md**: Added Extension Installer section with usage examples
4. **No deprecated code found** in documentation that needs removal

## Next Steps:

The documentation now accurately reflects:
- Extension installation centralized in SiP Plugins Core
- Installation wizard available from Core dashboard
- Individual extensions per plugin (current approach)
- Master extension as future vision when business needs clarify
- Pragmatic incremental approach that solves immediate problems
